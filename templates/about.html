          Hi there! I'm Vismaya, a Computer Science Engineering student at BNMIT with a deep passion for technology, creativity, and building meaningful tech solutions. Whether it's full-stack development, AI, or IoT—I love diving deep and learning as much as I can along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, I’ve built 70+ Python mini projects and explored 3 deep learning projects that pushed my boundaries and sparked my curiosity for what’s possible with code. I'm constantly experimenting, exploring new tools, and trying to turn ideas into something real.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through this blog, I share my journey—the wins, the roadblocks, the hacks, and the lessons. If you're someone who loves tech, learning, or just wants to follow along with someone figuring it all out one step (or bug) at a time—you’re in the right place!
